			<h2 class="about_bio">Energy Fields</h2>
				<p class="p_bio">Everything has an energy field that surrounds it, and everything has a unique vibration. Your body and each part of it – genes, cells, organs, emotions, psychological states, bacteria, viruses, vitamins, minerals…each one has a vibrational pattern. All of the parts of you together create your body’s energy field. When a vibration in your energy field is disrupted and gets out of balance, there is stress in your system, which is not good. It happens to everyone. </p>

				<p class="p_bio">If information about energy systems is new to you, think about anytime you met someone for the first time and instantly felt an attraction or repulsion. Mostly we attribute this to something physical, such as pheromones, but it could easily be explained by energy interactions: one person’s energy system is or is not compatible with another. </p>

				<p class="p_bio">Our energy fields interact with others’ energy fields all the time. Sometimes we pick up energy from one another, but it is possible that the energy in our systems represents a genetic predisposition, energetic inheritance, or historic carryover. We never know where the energy originates.</p>

				<p class="p_life">The L.I.F.E. System’s evoked potential biofeedback encourages your energy system to release stress by first scanning it against almost 7,000 factors.Those factors include cells, genes, and chromosomes; the acupressure meridian system; the chakras; organs and body parts; all known viruses, bacteria, parasites, pathogens, etc.; “vitamins/minerals/aminoacids, homeopathic remedies, ayurvedic remedies, and flower essences”; emotional and psychological states; and more.</p>

				<p class="p_life">Feedback can be sent to each one, individually, meaning that the program sends back to your system the very same information it just gleaned from it about a feature or an issue. Your system recognizes the imbalance in that energy and shifts to a more harmonious vibration, releasing stress.</p>

				<p class="p_life">The L.I.F.E. System program is very effective in helping your energy system to balance vibrational disturbances. Neurofeedback frequently shows an immediate impact upon acute conditions (sore muscles, emotional stress, etc.), which can become chronic conditions if corrections in the energy flow do not occur. Chronic conditions may be more resistant to change but can respond to repeated sessions with a skilled practitioner. Regularly scheduled sessions achieve and maintain the greatest benefit for all.</p>
