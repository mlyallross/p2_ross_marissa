								COVID-19 is frightening, and, although a session with the L.I.F.E. System may be helpful in releasing stress from your body, it cannot protect you from exposure to this or any other virus. There are many actions you can take to protect yourself, but nothing is foolproof except, perhaps, total isolation from others. Even then, you may experience debilitating stress in this frightening climate.
								Having a strong immune system is a good defense against any disease, though, so keeping your immune system strong is a very good choice. Reducing stress supports your immune system, allowing it to protect you more efficiently and effectively. Consequently, having a biofeedback session is certainly a powerfully proactive thing to do. 
								The L.I.F.E. System is certified by the F.D.A. as a stress-reduction device. One of its greatest strengths, especially when you don’t want to be face-to-face with another human, is that it is entirely possible to have a session at a distance: You do not have to be in the same location as your technician. Once your identifying information is entered in the program, the L.I.F.E. System uses electromagnetic signals and a special type of GPS technology to locate and communicate with your energy system. There is a specific mode in the system called “metaspace” which allows a session to occur in this way. 
								My experience working in metaspace with family members, friends, and clients I’ve never met in person, who may be scattered around the nation and even in other places in the world, is that they report positive shifts in how they feel, physically, mentally, and/or emotionally. Of course, as with in-person sessions, some people experience changes immediately, and some experience shifts over a period of hours or a few days.</p>

									Primarily, stress is a survival mechanism that starts in the brain and triggers what is commonly known as the “fight or flight syndrome.” In animals “fight or flight” is a reaction to a triggering event – something unexpected and startling. The reaction ends when the event ends, and the animal goes about its business. We humans, though, with our advanced brains and memories, tend to remain on alert, perceiving ongoing danger where it might not exist. Researchers and medical professionals agree that ongoing and intense stress stands to take a toll on our physical and mental health.
									For example, you might have had a near-miss car accident on the freeway and after that, you have great anxiety whenever you see an entrance ramp. This is a form of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Of course, sometimes there is real threat, such as if you have a hostile supervisor at work who sends angry emails at unexpected moments. In some cases, a certain amount of “fight or flight” might be helpful to motivate you to take necessary action: in this situation, to talk to HR or to look for a new job. Once you have dealt with the issue and it is in the past, the threat is gone, and the stress should go away, too; but it often does not.
									Sometimes in situations of danger, we lack clear information and direction, such as with COVID-19. At a time like this, the only thing we can control is our choices, determined at least in part by how we handle stress. In this case, the stressors are many. We’ve had to separate ourselves from one another physically. This, alone, can be very stressful. Then we must find ways to cope with decreased work and possibly less income plus increased concerns about other issues, such as supporting our children’s learning. Not only are the unknowns of this situation stressful, but so is the total change in lifestyle, and it continues over time.  
									Since ongoing stress can set us up for physical, emotional, and/or mental malfunction or dis-ease, we need to address it. Stress that stays with us can lead to high blood pressure, headaches, digestive disorders, anxiety attacks, all degrees of Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, depression, and other negative impacts upon our bodies’ systems. These impacts may lead to other more severe conditions.
									To assess your personal stress level, ask yourself: Have you lost your appetite or do you have digestive discomfort after a meal? Does your heart sometimes pound for no apparent reason? Do you feel exhausted but find it difficult to sleep through the night, to crawl out of bed in the morning, to reach out to others, or even to answer your phone? Are you feeling angry or impatient to a greater degree than usual, and do you snap at your kids….or your dog?
									The L.I.F.E. System can help! It will support the release of stress in your system, allowing your body to function more effectively. Following biofeedback sessions, many say they feel “lighter,” calmer, and more peaceful. In subsequent days, they may report experiencing increased energy, a more optimistic outlook, and even alleviation of some issues that plagued them beforehand, such as headaches. When your body is balanced by releasing stress from your energy system, it is miraculously able to function better overall.</p>

									Every body reacts differently to pathogens, and there are no magical, invisible shields to prevent illness. Even people who get flu vaccinations sometimes get the flu. However, when your immune system is strong and not overly taxed by stress, it is easier for it to fight any infection. The L.I.F.E. System helps your body release stress, and that helps your immune system to be stronger and more prepared to fight viruses, bacteria, or other micro-organisms that you might knowingly or, more likely, unknowingly encounter. 
									Reducing stress in your body’s energy system supports your immune system and your overall health. It also supports your mental-emotional well-being. In a sense, stress leads to more stress, as it affects the way you perceive life and react to it. When stress mounts, some people withdraw, some lash out, and others get sick. All of these reactions tax your capacity to function efficiently and effectively, strain your immune system, and lead to unanticipated consequences. 
									There is no down-side to reducing stress in your energy system, and the L.I.F.E. System can help you accomplish that.

								<p class="blog">
								As if life isn’t stressful enough on a daily/weekly/monthly basis anyway, here come the holidays again!
								Yes, there is the shopping, depleting cash resources and/or increasing credit card debt. And there is
								trying to please everyone on your list. The thing we love and dread the most is the infamous, mandatory
								family gatherings. You have to spend hours with your father, who is very sarcastic, or with your mother
								who loves to criticize. Perhaps your sister who always mentions your weight will be at dinner, counting
								your calories; or your brother who holds a different and very opinionated political opinion will show up.
								You can walk into these situations with calmness and peace in your heart. Bring down your inner heat
								with L.I.F.E. System Biofeedback Device stress-reduction sessions. A common experience during a
								session is tremendous relaxation. Afterward a common comment is “I feel lighter.”
								If you want to feel “lighter” going into your holiday festivities, <a href="contact.html">contact Barbara</a> for your
								biofeedback sessions.</p>
