                <p class="p_bio">How Does the L.I.F.E. Professional Biofeedback Device Operate?</p>

				<p class="p_bio">A session begins with the creation of your unique ID by entering your name, address, a recent photograph, date of birth, city and state of birth, and time of birth (if available). A sophisticated program, L.I.F.E. System uses a GPS-style satellite tracker to identify your exact location at the time of the session by connecting with your energy system, which is limitless. This proprietary system was originally built on a remote (virtual) platform to administer to individuals in areas of the world who had limited or no access to treatment. Both the harness, directly applied, or the virtual treatment are effective. </p>

				<p class="p_bio">You may add a personalized affirmation: a statement you use to uplift yourself. I will ask you if you want to share one or two stress-related physical, emotional, and mental issues you would like to address during the session, which will last approximately one hour.</p>

				<p class="p_bio">The session begins when I ask you to relax and breathe slowly, and then I will direct the L.I.F.E. System to establish the interface with your energy system. From this point forward, you may feel more and more relaxed. Some people even fall asleep. As the session progresses, you might feel minor sensations as your energy system responds to the biofeedback. After the session, many people say they notice feeling relaxed, lighter, and a sense of inner peace. </p>
